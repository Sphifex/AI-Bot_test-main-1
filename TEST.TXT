 1.dp npot jsut ask about persons feeling do not jsut ask about bands and music taste first?
have the bot inindirectly  ask for the types of bands user has been listening to?


based off those bands it should  analyzyze trhe bands given to determin the mood and energey level or sentment and intent of the user
2. Build some repore with the user ask them how they are doing and whaty they are currently doign that makes them want to lsiten to music but in a conversaitonal huma way that is not lame or robitic
 do not go striagt in to asking about persons mood or feeling uuntil affter you gather some keey data about the music the interact and lsiten to 

3.
it should ask the user if thats what they are still interested in listeneg to
